            <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-1">The Open Society and Its Enemies by Karl Popper</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">When Erik Kandel went on a limb to study memory by analyzing neural processes
                in the giant snail Aplysia, Karl Popper encouraged him. But he didn't encourage Kandel by telling him
                that he was going to be right. The nature of Popper's encouragement captures his attitude towards
                science. </p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2"> Aplysia has few neurons, and they are large, 
                making its nervous system easy to study.
                When Kandel was researching them, almost all of his colleagues believed that you could not extrapolate
                learnings from non-complex systems, like giant snails, to complex ones, like humans. Kandel thought that
                it might be possible, and he decided to go against the grain.</p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">Popper told Kandel that he should try and run head first into the face of
                failure. In Popper's view, Kandel's job as a scientist was not to be right. His job was to make sure
                that beliefs were grounded in evidence, and there was limited evidence that non-complex systems could
                not inform the study of complex ones. Kandel ran towards failure, and as luck would have it,
                there was no failure on the other end. There was a Nobel prize. (Read In Search of Memory by Erik Kandel
                to learn more about Kandel's work and his recollection of his interactions with Popper.)</p>

            <p class="text-gray-700">In The Open Society, Popper carefully dismantles political ideas that make us more
                inclined to believe in unproven positives rather than acknowledging the true limitations of our
                knowledge. It's a remarkable and inspiring demonstration of Popper's own analytical ability, which
                allowed him to see past centuries old biases and outline a concise attack on long-standing traditions of
                political philosophy.</p>

            <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-1">Flights by Olga Tokarczuk</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">
                In Black Boy, Richard Wright talks about 
                how he could not write well when he was younger. He tried, but nothing came of it. 
                So he resorted to writing perfect sentences. Great sentences that would transport him 
                to a different world.
            </p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">No small amount of credit goes to Jennifer Croft
                for what is truly a remarkable English translation of Tokarczuk's Polish text. But one can only
                marvel at the perfection with which Tokarczuk executes each sentence, and strings
                them together to write passages that provoke flights of thought. 
            </p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">My favorite story is that of a mother who leaves home one day
                and doesn't return for a long time. She remains homeless in a train station. But it 
                isn't a story about someone escaping from the normalcy of their life. 
                It is a story about what happened, with no why or hows behind it. It's a story that
                 provokes wonder instead of analysis. And that is Tokarzcuk's magic. To 
                distance her work from frameworks of analysis and let things be.
            </p>

            <p class="text-gray-700">Perhaps Tokarzcuk lets us know what to expect in the beginning. 
                She talks about her days as a student of psychology and her fascination with what
                is odd instead of what is ordinary. One thing is for sure, there is nothing ordinary about 
                Flights.

            <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-1">Super-infinite by Katherine Rundell</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">
                Donne was an English poet, a contemporary of Shakespeare. At one
                point in his life, he almost died as a prisoner in the Tower of London. 
                At another, he was one of the most loved preachers in London, so much so
                that the King attended his sermons. Donne's poetry wouldn't be
                published until after sdfhis death. But his remarkable style and skill 
                would quickly establish him as a master innovator.
            </p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2"> 
                Donne's biography, like all biographies, is as much a story as it is fact. After all, it is only
                through curation that a whole life can fit into a book. 
                And as truthful as Rundell's biography probably is, she leaves
                no leaf unturned to show how uncertain and improbable life can
                be. And she carries out her work of non-fiction with the 
                kind of rare flair with which Virginia Woolf wrote the fictional
                biography of Orlando, another story about a highly improbable life.
            </p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">
                It is refreshing to read a recounting of someone's life that does not search for reasons
                behind their greatness. And instead focuses on the fragile moments in which
                luck and chance, more than anything, led to the creation of a 
                fascinating personage.
            </p>

            <p class="text-gray-700">
                Maybe Rundell writes in the same spirit as Donne's works. In her work, Donne comes
                off as uniquely human, but that adds to the
                the marvels he wrote during his life. And Donne's own
                works, while striving for the spirit of infinity, 
                are grounded in our messy, non-ideal, physical world.

        <div class="mb-4">
            <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-1">Being and Time by Martin Heidegger</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">
                Some books, like math theory textbooks, require careful study. And even then,
                much remains in the way of mastery. Being and Time falls squarely into that category, 
                partly due its complexity, and partly due to the fact that Heidegger did not
                care to write well.
                It's not a text that I would have read
                outside of a course focused only on it with a Heidegger expert, Professor Martin Hagglund. 
                But it is
                a text well worth reading.
            </p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2"> 
                Heidegger is interested in the most basic philosophical question: How do we experience
                everyday life as humans? And he doesn't take an experimental approach. He uses formal logic to 
                dissect the very nature of everyday human experience. But
                his deep, philosophical analysis reminds one of experimental and theoretical frameworks, like
                Daniel Kahneman's System 1 and System 2 (fast and slow thinking), 
                or Piaget's theory of child development.
            </p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">
                Though, ultimately, Heidegger's book is trying to communicate the central importance of finiteness. 
                He posits that any action we take in life has meaning only because our lives
                are finite. Taking any action always comes at the cost of time, and
                there is no way to recover that cost.
            </p>

            <p class="text-gray-700">
                But Heidegger is not asking us to focus our energies on good, important actions. 
                Not in the slightest. 
                He coolly accepts that we have very little control over the circumstances in which 
                are born and in which we live our lives. 
                Instead, his book on being offers us an orthogonal choice: to care or not care about what we're doing.
