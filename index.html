          The Open Society and Its Enemies by Karl Popper
        </h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2 text-sm">
          When Erik Kandel went on a limb to study memory by analyzing neural
          processes in the giant snail Aplysia, Karl Popper encouraged him. But
          he didn't encourage Kandel by telling him that he was going to be
          right. The nature of Popper's encouragement captures his attitude
          towards science.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2 text-sm">
          Aplysia has few neurons, and they are large, making its nervous system
          easy to study. When Kandel was researching them, almost all of his
          colleagues believed that you could not extrapolate learnings from
          non-complex systems, like giant snails, to complex ones, like humans.
          Kandel thought that it might be possible, and he decided to go against
          the grain.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2 text-sm">
          Popper told Kandel that he should try and run head first into the face
          of failure. In Popper's view, Kandel's job as a scientist was not to
          be right. His job was to make sure that beliefs were grounded in
          evidence, and there was limited evidence that non-complex systems
          could not inform the study of complex ones. Kandel ran towards
          failure, and as luck would have it, there was no failure on the other
          end. There was a Nobel prize. (Read In Search of Memory by Erik Kandel
          to learn more about Kandel's work and his recollection of his
          interactions with Popper.)
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm">
          In The Open Society, Popper carefully dismantles political ideas that
          make us more inclined to believe in unproven positives rather than
          acknowledging the true limitations of our knowledge. It's a remarkable
          and inspiring demonstration of Popper's own analytical ability, which
          allowed him to see past centuries old biases and outline a concise
          attack on long-standing traditions of political philosophy.

        <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-1">Flights by Olga Tokarczuk</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2 text-sm">
          In Black Boy, Richard Wright talks about how he could not write well
          when he was young. He tried, but nothing came of it. So he resorted to
          writing perfect sentences. Great sentences that would transport him to
          a different world.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2 text-sm">
          No small amount of credit goes to Jennifer Croft for what is truly a
          remarkable English translation of Tokarczuk's Polish text. But one can
          only marvel at the perfection with which Tokarczuk executes each
          sentence, and strings them together to write passages that provoke
          flights of thought.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2 text-sm">
          My favorite story is that of a mother who leaves home one day and
          doesn't return for a long time. She remains homeless in a train
          station. But it isn't a story about someone escaping from the normalcy
          of their life. It is a story about what happened, with no why or hows
          behind it. It's a story that provokes wonder instead of analysis. And
          that is Tokarzcuk's magic. To distance her work from frameworks of
          analysis and let things be.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm">
          Perhaps Tokarzcuk lets us know what to expect in the beginning. She
          talks about her days as a student of psychology and her fascination
          with what is odd instead of what is ordinary. One thing is for sure,
          there is nothing ordinary about Flights.

          Super-infinite by Katherine Rundell
        </h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2 text-sm">
          Donne was an English poet, a contemporary of Shakespeare. At one point
          in his life, he almost died as a prisoner in the Tower of London. At
          another, he was one of the most loved preachers in London, so much so
          that the King attended his sermons. Donne's poetry wouldn't be
          published until after his death. But his remarkable style and skill
          would quickly establish him as a master innovator.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2 text-sm">
          Donne's biography, like all biographies, is as much a story as it is
          fact. After all, it is only through curation that a whole life can fit
          into a book. And as truthful as Rundell's biography of Donne probably
          is, she leaves no leaf unturned to show how uncertain and improbable
          life can be. And she carries out her work of non-fiction with the kind
          of rare flair with which Virginia Woolf wrote the fictional biography
          of Orlando, another story about a highly improbable life.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2 text-sm">
          It is refreshing to read a recounting of someone's life that does not
          search for reasons behind their greatness. And instead focuses on the
          fragile moments in which luck and chance, more than anything, led to
          the creation of a fascinating personage.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm">
          Maybe Rundell writes in the same spirit as Donne's works. In her work,
          Donne comes off as uniquely human, but that adds to the the marvels he
          wrote during his life. And Donne's own works, while deeply moving and
          often highly spiritual, are grounded in the reality of everyday life.

          Being and Time by Martin Heidegger
        </h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2 text-sm">
          Some books, like math theory textbooks, require careful study. And
          even then, much remains in the way of mastery. Being and Time falls
          squarely into that category, partly due its complexity, and partly due
          to the fact that Heidegger did not care to write well. It's not a text
          that I would have read outside of a course focused only on it with a
          Heidegger expert, Professor Martin Hagglund. But it is a text well
          worth reading.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2 text-sm">
          Heidegger is interested in the most elementary philosophical question:
          How do we experience everyday life as humans? And he doesn't take an
          experimental approach. He uses formal logic to dissect the very nature
          of our being. And his deep, philosophical analysis reminds one of
          experimental and theoretical frameworks, like Daniel Kahneman's System
          1 and System 2 (fast and slow thinking), or Piaget's theory of child
          development.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2 text-sm">
          What stood out to me from Heidegger's book is the notion of
          finiteness. He posits that any action we take in life has meaning only
          because our lives are finite. Taking an action always comes at the
          cost of time, and there is no way to recover that cost, regardless of
          who we are.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm">
          But Heidegger is not a normative thinker, asking us to focus our
          energies on good, worthwhile actions. Not in the slightest. He coolly
          accepts that we have little control over the circumstances in which
          are born and in which we live our lives. Instead, his book on being
          offers us an orthogonal choice: to care or not care about what we're
          doing.

          The Order of Time by Carlo Rovelli
        </h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2 text-sm">
          What I love about Rovelli's book isn't just his unique ability to
          simply convey complex topics in modern theoretical physics. It's that
          it is humbling. In every age, science pretends to be at its pinnacle.
          But it always has a long, long way to go. Rovelli remind us of this.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2 text-sm">
          Imagine that the universe is an ocean. Somewhere in that ocean,
          there's a ripple. The ripple causes a group of particles to move in a
          certain direction. It also causes the particles to run into each other
          and create patterns. Inside that ripple, within those patterns, is our
          world.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2 text-sm">
          Rovelli says that we experience linear time because the ripple is
          pushing us in one direction. He calls it the direction of increasing
          entropy. Perhaps, the push is like skydiving. It's theoretically
          possible to go up, but the skydiver can't. But what's more fascinating
          to me is the that all that exists around us is a function of the same
          push, from simple atoms to the complexity if human biology.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm">
            There is very little that we understand about the underlying processes
            of our universe. 
            Maybe that will change with time. 
            And open up a whole new world for humanity. 
            But until then, it's a good reminder 
            that we have a long way to go.
